cakePHP Wordpress Component

The cakePHP Wordpress Component will fetch your posts from your Wordpress blog
for further use in your cakePHP application.
It retrieves your posts via mysql, so you need access to the blog-database.
You have several options of how to display your posts and how the links should
look (Pretty-URls supported)


USAGE
- Clone/Copy the component file into your application components

- Change the server and database settings to your needs in the component
  
- Include 'Wordpress' in the components array in your controller

- The post limit, niceurls, clean and allowed tags can be changed on the fly:
    
    $wordpress->limit = 5;
    $wordpress->niceurls = true;
    $wordpress->clean = true;
    $wordpress->allowed_tags = null;
    

- In your controller use the following to grab the posts:

	$this->Wordpress->limit = 3;
	$this->Wordpress->niceurls = true;
	$this->Wordpress->thumbnails = true;
	$wordpress_posts = $this->Wordpress->getLatest();


- If you use caching you could go like this:

	$wordpress_posts = Cache::read( 'wordpress_posts', 'enter_your_key_name_here' );
	if ( $wordpress_posts === false ) {
		$this->Wordpress->limit = 3;
		$this->Wordpress->niceurls = true;
		$this->Wordpress->thumbnails = true;
		$wordpress_posts = $this->Wordpress->getLatest();
		Cache::write('wordpress_posts', $wordpress_posts, 'enter_your_key_name_here');
	}
	$this->set('wordpress_posts', $wordpress_posts);


- Then in your view maybe:

	if( $wordpress_posts ){
		foreach($wordpress_posts as $post):
			// Thumbnail
			$post_thumbnail = '/path/to/your/placeholder-image.jpg';
			if(isset($post['thumbnail_100x100'])) {
				$post_thumbnail = $post['thumbnail_100x100'];
			}

			echo h($post['title']);
			echo $post['link'];
			echo $text->truncate( str_replace("\n", "", $post['content']), 200, array('exact'=>true, 'ending'=>'') );
			echo '<img src="' . $post_thumbnail . '" width="100" height="100" class="" alt="" />';
		endforeach;
	}



CACHING
Recommended. If your site has many visitors or you like it fast, think about
caching the results of the component like shown above, or memcache... or any
other technique.



** Note about using permalinks: **
Do not use %tag%, %category% or %author% in your permalinks because this 
Component won't replace those tags for now. It's a huge database slowdown
to fetch all the records for categories, tags or authors just to display
a short feed of posts on another site.
