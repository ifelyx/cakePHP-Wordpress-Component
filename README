cakePHP Wordpress Helper

Loads the latest posts from a wordpress database and returns them
for displaying inside a cakePHP application.

Attention:
Do not use %tag%, %category% or %author% in your permalinks because this 
Helper won't replace those tags for now. It's a huge database slowdown
to fetch all the records for categories, tags or authors just to display
a short feed of posts on another site.
